Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, spices, chocolate, butter, peanut butter, nuts, or dried fruits. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.\r\n\r\nA general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called \"batter\"[4]) as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles \u0096 responsible for a cake's fluffiness \u0096 to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, egg yolks, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.\r\n\r\nOils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not sink into it.", "highlighted_text": ["Cookies", "baked", "cookies", "baked", "Cookies", "cookie", "baked", "cookies", "cakes", "cookie", "water", "Water", "cakes", "cakes", "cake", "cookie", "oil", "Oils", "oils", "water", "water", "cake", "water", "Oils", "baked", "cakes", "water", "baking", "cookie", "oil"], "hashtags": ["cake", "water", "cooki", "oil", "bake"]}]}ephones rapidly became indispensable to businesses, government, and households, and are today some of the most widely used small appliances.\r\n\r\nThe essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice of the distant person. In addition, most telephones contain a ringer which produces a sound to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial used to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone. Until approximately the 1970s most telephones used a rotary dial, which was superseded by the modern DTMF push-button dial, first introduced by AT&T in 1963.[1] The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The dial may be located either on the handset, or on a base unit to which the handset is connected. The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telephone network to the receiving phone. The receiving telephone converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver, or sometimes a loudspeaker. Telephones are a duplex communications medium, meaning they allow the people on both ends to talk simultaneously.", "hashtags": ["telephon", "signal", "sound", "voic", "receiv"]}]}
