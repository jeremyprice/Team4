Client Meeting Minutes
9-17-2014

Discussion:
	
	Feedback from Problem Statement:
	- When discussing scalability, the P.S. should include definitive numbers instead of adjectives such as "massive"
	- An additional feature of the system is to include a Confidence Metric, ranking how well the system believes it did in summarizing the abstract.
	- Two items not yet included on the P.S. are the system's name and any software and hardware requirements.  This will be included for the first sprint.
	
	Sprint Information:
	- Following discussions between Jeremy and Professor Kultur, sprints will maintain a length of one week.
	- The structure of the sprints will have alternating purpose, between feature development and testing / quality assurance.
	- The amount of features included in each sprint will be adjusted throughout the year as what is optimal becomes more apparent.
	- The initial sprint will contain spikes to help determine the infrastructure set up of the system.
	- Given time constraints surrounding meeting times, the initial plan will be for sprints to begin and end on Wednesdays, to allow for sprint review / planning to occur during the client meeting.
	
Action Items:

	- The development team will complete internal documentation on the project plan, required by the project advisor.
	- Jeremy will fill the Sprint Backlog for the initial sprint. The team will review and respond with any questions/concerns.
	- The development team will meet with the project advisor on Thursday to discuss the current progress and direction of the project.
